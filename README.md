# Covid-19-data-exploration-using-SQL

## Project Overview
This repository dives into the analysis of COVID-19 data using various SQL techniques, aiming to unravel insights and trends across regions and timelines. Our goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact on different parts of the world.
•Data Fusion: Combine data from multiple sources to create a unified dataset encompassing case counts, deaths, and population statistics.

• Enhancing Readability: Break down complex queries into manageable steps using CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for clearer comprehension.

• Boosting Performance: Leverage temporary tables to optimize query execution and minimize redundant calculations.

• Promoting Reusability: Create a pre-calculated view named "PercentPopulationVaccinated" for easier access to vaccination percentage data.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as a collection of SQL queries, each targeting a specific aspect of the COVID-19 data. These queries showcase diverse SQL techniques and methodologies to answer various analytical questions.


## Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have a suitable SQL environment (e.g., MySQL workbench, PostgreSQL) configured with access to the chosen COVID-19 data sources.
Each query file comes with descriptive comments explaining its purpose and functionalities.
Feel free to modify and adapt the queries to fit your specific research questions or data sets.
